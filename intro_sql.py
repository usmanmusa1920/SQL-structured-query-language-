SQL stands for (Structured Query Language) it is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in database. By convention SQL keywords are use all in uppercase e.g SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc, in other to make it easy to read, although it is case-sensitive. Also we are going to take our hands step by step to know how to use MYSQL, POSTGRESQL, and possibly some others, so stay tuned. Before we dive deep we have to know a little bit about the above mention databases (mysql, postgreql).
